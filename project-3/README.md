# Simple Blockchain

Blockchain has the potential to change the way that the world approaches data. This simple blockchain provides a RESTful API to get blocks and add new blocks.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Installing Node and NPM is pretty straightforward using the installer package available from the [Node.jsÂ® web site](https://nodejs.org/en/).

### Running the application

- Use NPM to install project dependencies.
```
npm install
```

Start the express app with node:
```
node .\app.js
```
The site is now running on localhost:8000!

### API Documentation

The provided API is powered by [express.js](https://expressjs.com/), a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node.js.

#### Endpoints

    GET /chain
        Returns a JSON array of all blocks in the chain

    GET /block/:BLOCK_HEIGHT
        Returns a block at a specific height

    POST /block
        Adds a new block to the chain

```
curl "http://localhost:8000/block/0"
```
##### POST block
```
curl -X "POST" "http://localhost:8000/block" \
     -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     -d $'{
  "body": "Testing block with test string data"
}'
```
